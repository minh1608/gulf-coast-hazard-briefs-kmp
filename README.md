🌧️ Gulf Coast Hazard Briefs

A Kotlin Multiplatform Weekly Weather Briefing App for Humanitarian Use

Gulf Coast Hazard Briefs is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) application that automatically collects National Weather Service (NWS) data and generates a clear, multi-page weekly hazard brief for the Texas Gulf Coast Region.

The app is designed for humanitarian and emergency workflows — such as emergency planning, volunteer coordination, and situational awareness — where fast, readable summaries matter more than raw meteorological charts.

Built once, shared everywhere: Android + Desktop (JVM), with an experimental Web preview.

✨ What This Project Does
	•	Fetches real NWS forecast and alert data
	•	Applies rule-based hazard logic in shared Kotlin code
	•	Automatically generates a multi-page weekly brief
	•	Presents the same brief consistently on Android and Desktop
	•	Optimized for quick review, not expert interpretation

Current Pages

Page 1 — Weekly Overview
Forecast timeline, temperature ranges, precipitation chances, and confidence

Page 2 — Active Hazard Spotlight
What / Where / When / Impacts + recommended actions

Page 3 — Flooding & Rainfall Context
External map previews (WPC, radar, graphical forecast) with safe fallbacks

🧠 Why It Matters

During severe or complex weather weeks, responders often need to answer:
	•	What’s the main risk this week?
	•	Where should we pay attention?
	•	What actions should we take now?

This project turns raw weather data into human-readable briefings, reducing cognitive load and making it easier for non-meteorologists to act quickly and confidently.

📸 Screenshots

Below are screenshots from both Android and Desktop builds, demonstrating that the same shared hazard engine produces identical weekly briefs across platforms.

🧩 Project Architecture

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project with shared logic and platform-specific UIs.

composeApp/
commonMain/     Shared hazard logic, models, brief builder
androidMain/    Android-specific UI & integrations
jvmMain/        Desktop (JVM) UI
wasmJsMain/     Experimental Web (WASM)
jsMain/         JS fallback
	•	commonMain contains the hazard engine, rules, and page models
	•	All platforms use the same BriefBuilder
	•	Compose Multiplatform renders UI consistently across targets

🧩 Coding Style & Conventions

This project follows the official Kotlin Coding Conventions, including:
	•	Clear package structure (data, domain, logic, brief)
	•	Data classes for models and sealed classes for page types
	•	Explicit null-safety and coroutine-based async design
	•	Shared logic written once and reused across platforms

The goal is to keep the hazard engine readable, testable, and idiomatic for Kotlin Multiplatform.
